Project Overview
This project is a user list application that displays a list of users, allows new users to be added, and existing users to be edited and deleted.

Project Setup
1. Create a new React project using `create-react-app`.
2. Install necessary packages such as `axios` or `fetch` (for API calls) and `react-router-dom` (for navigation).
3. Run the project using `npm start`.

Component Structure
- _App Component_: The main wrapper that holds all child components.
- _UserList Component_: Displays the list of users.
- _UserForm Component_: Handles adding and editing user details.
  

State Management
- User Data: Stores the list of users fetched from the API.
- Form State: Stores the current user data for add/edit functionality.
- Error State: Stores any error messages to display when API requests fail.

Challenges and Potential Improvements
- Implement pagination or infinite scrolling.
- Implement client-side validation.
- Implement a responsive UI.
